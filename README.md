This repository contains a community supported firmware for the Tidbyt hardware ü§ì.

## Warning
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! Flashing your Tidbyt with this firmware or derivatives could fatally 
damage your device. As such, flashing your Tidbyt with this firmware or
derivatives voids your warranty and comes without support.

## Setup
This project uses PlatformIO to build, flash, and monitor firmware on the Tidbyt.
To get started, you will need to download [PlatformIO Core][2] on your computer.

Additionally, this firmware is designed to work with [Pixlet][1]. Using
`pixlet serve`, you can serve a WebP on your local network. Take note of your
computers IP address and replace it in the `TIDBYT_REMOTE_URL` example above.
While we had pixlet in mind, you can point this firmware at any URL that hosts
a WebP image that is optimized for the Tidbyt display.

## Configuration (secrets.h)
Before running the application, you need to configure the `src/secrets.h` file with the following:

```c
// WiFi credentials
#define TIDBYT_WIFI_SSID "Your WiFi Network Name"
#define TIDBYT_WIFI_PASSWORD "Your WiFi Password"

// Base URL for your pixlet server
const char* BASE_URL = "http://your-server-ip-or-hostname:3000";

// Applet paths to display (these are paths that will be appended to BASE_URL)
const char* APPLET_PARAMS[] = {
  "/?fileName=applet1",
  "/?fileName=applet2&param1=value1&param2=value2",
  // Add more applet configurations as needed
};
```

The `APPLET_PARAMS` array defines which pixlet applets will be displayed in rotation, with each URL being constructed by combining the `BASE_URL` with the path and parameters for that specific applet.

## Getting Started
To flash the custom firmware on your device, run the following after replacing
the variables with your desired information:
```
TIDBYT_WIFI_SSID='Your WiFi' \
TIDBYT_WIFI_PASSWORD='super-secret' \
TIDBYT_REMOTE_URL='http://192.168.10.10:8080/api/v1/preview.webp' \
 pio run --environment adafruit_matrixportal_esp32s3 --target upload
```

## Monitoring Logs
To check the output of your running firmware, run the following:
```
pio device monitor
```

## Back to Normal
To get your Tidbyt back to normal, you can run the following to flash the
production firmware onto your Tidbyt:
```
pio run --target reset
```

Add applets to the APPLETS char array in main.c to upload.
When uploading, use PlatformIO's VS Code extension. Try different cables if the upload does not find the USB port.
